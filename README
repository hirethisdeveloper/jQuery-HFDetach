Project: jQuery HFDetach

Given the html structure for example(does not need to be like this, this is just an example):



<div class="footer">
  <div class="footerbar ">
    <div class="footerbarinner ">
      <div class="footer_links"> 
  	<a href="#">some links here that will fix to the bottom of the window</a> | <a href="#">some links here</a> | <a href="#">some links here</a>
      </div>	
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="footercontent bmargin-50">
    <div class="footercontentinner">
      <p>Some static footer content that stays at the bottom.</p>	
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


calling ----------------------------

<script type="text/javascript">
$(function() {
	$("div.footer").hfdetach({
		'opt_obj': $("div.footerbar"),
		'zindex': 500
	});
});
</script>

------------------------------------

Will detach div.footerbar from the dom, and place it in a CSS position:fixed; bottom:0px; that will remain until you scroll down to where footerbar would have resided on the page if not position:fixed. Once you reach the "threshold" place which is the place where the footerbar would have normally been displayed with out the script, it will automatically reattach itself there until/unless you scroll back up which will automatically detach it again and fix it to the window bottom.

Note: although the script is called HFDetach, which stands for Header/Footer Detach, I've only used it for footers, but in theory it would work for any object.
